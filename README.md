It was determined in May of 2011 that 94.11% of all Wikipedia articles eventually led to the Philosophy article by visiting the first link on each page. The rest lead to dead ends or continous loops.

This script, given a valid title of a wikipedia article, will attempt to crawl its way to the Philosophy article by visiting the first link on each page.

A more detailed description of this phenomenon can be found [here](https://nextnature.net/story/2015/wikipedia-roads-lead-philosophy). The theory behind this notion is that the first link on each page tends to bring readers to broader, more generalized topics that eventually lead to Philosophy (with an average of 23 article visits). 

The [Getting to Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) Wikipedia article has more information on this as well.
