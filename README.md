# path-to-philosophy
Given a wikipedia page, crawl to Philosophy
It was determined in May of 2011 that 94.11% of all Wikipedia articles eventually led to the Philosophy article.
The rest lead to dead ends or continous loops.
This script, given a valid title of a wikipedia article, will attempt to crawl its way to the Philosophy article
by visiting the first link on each page.
